A group project built in react with a two week deadline, with instructions to make a CRUD application in react where users should be able to create bookings, admin should be able to edit and delete customers and bookings, and booking should be disabled when capacity has been reached. (Over 15 bookings at one particular time, on a particular date). 

This can be seen at the time of writing by trying to book a time on the 2nd of February, 2024 at 18:00.

The admin route being protected by OAuth serves as an example of how routes could be protected within the application. In this project, all users have access to the admin side to perform CRUD operations against the database. This means that regardless of user roles, all authenticated users can interact with the admin functionalities, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting bookings and customers.
